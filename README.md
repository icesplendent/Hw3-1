# Hw3-1

## Implementation

    - connect the port
    - send mode from master to slave
    - double check the mode received at slave
    - send value from master to slave
    - receive the return value from slave at master

## Results

    - mode = 1, slave returns value + 1
    - mode = 2, slave returns value + 2
    - else, slave returns value
